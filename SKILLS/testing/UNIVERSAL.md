## 🔍 Skill: AdaptiveProjectAnalysis
*Analysis-first architectural skill to evaluate, validate, and conditionally refactor project structures.*

* **Core Principle**: Architecture exists to reduce the cost of change; if the cost of change is already low, do nothing.
* [cite_start]**Mandatory Analysis (Phase 1)**: Before recommending changes, analyze language (Python/JS/TS), project type, architecture signals (Clean, Hexagonal, DDD), and project maturity (Prototype vs. Production)[cite: 121, 132, 133, 134, 135].
* **Structural Health Check (Phase 2)**:
    * 🟢 **Green — Healthy**: Clear separation of layers, isolated frontend/backend, and centralized config. [cite_start]**Action**: Validate and generate documentation only[cite: 43, 224].
    * 🟡 **Yellow — Advisory**: Minor mixing of concerns or monorepo without strict boundaries. **Action**: Suggest incremental improvements without enforced refactors.
    * 🔴 **Red — Refactor Required**: Mixed frontend/backend, hardcoded secrets, or business logic inside UI/Controllers. [cite_start]**Action**: Propose a staged, low-risk refactor plan[cite: 32, 33, 126].
* [cite_start]**Compatibility Rule**: If the project already follows Clean Architecture, Hexagonal Architecture, or DDD, validate and document only; never override existing architecture-enforcing skills[cite: 12, 13, 47].
* [cite_start]**Hard Constraints**: Changes must be incremental and reversible; prefer moving files over rewriting logic[cite: 39, 120].
* [cite_start]**Documentation Requirement**: Always maintain or update `docs/architecture.md`, `decisions.md` (ADRs), and `conventions.md`[cite: 28, 44, 49, 57].
* [cite_start]**Docstring Standards**: All public-facing code must have JSDoc (JS), TSDoc (TS), or Docstrings (Python) explaining **intent**, not implementation details[cite: 51, 146].



## 🏗️ Skill: ArchitectureDesign
*Maintain a clean, modular system that separates business intent from technical implementation.*

* [cite_start]**Modular Monolith**: Implement a Modular Monolith using Hexagonal (Clean) Architecture patterns[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Domain Purity**: The Domain Layer must remain "pure" and independent of any framework, database, or AI SDK[cite: 13, 43].
* [cite_start]**Separation of Concerns (SRP)**: Strictly separate domain logic from Infrastructure (data access) and Presentation (UI) layers[cite: 14, 48].
* [cite_start]**Functional Grouping**: Organize code by functional domain (e.g., Requirements, Validation) rather than just technical layers[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**SOLID Compliance**: Adhere to SOLID principles, ensuring each class or module has a single reason to change[cite: 42, 48, 298, 299].
* [cite_start]**Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Ensure high-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces), not low-level implementations[cite: 315, 316, 317, 318].

## 🛡️ Skill: SecurityDevSecOps
*Integrate security into every layer of the software development lifecycle.*

* [cite_start]**Strict Validation**: Validate all external data and API inputs using strict schemas like Zod or Valibot[cite: 52, 126, 241, 264].
* [cite_start]**OWASP for LLMs**: Implement specific defenses against Prompt Injection and prevent sensitive data leakage into logs[cite: 56, 249, 250, 272, 273].
* [cite_start]**Injection Defense**: Use parameterized logic and avoid dynamic string templates or `eval()` for commands and queries[cite: 89, 246, 265].
* [cite_start]**Secure Headers**: Implement **Helmet.js** to enforce critical security headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP)[cite: 56, 90, 247, 268].
* [cite_start]**Secret Management**: Never commit credentials; use `.env` files validated at runtime and scan for secrets using tools like GitLeaks[cite: 85, 253, 269].

## 🧪 Skill: QualityTesting (Honest Coverage & Automation)
*Prioritize real logic over boilerplate using a tiered strategy and automated enforcement.*

* [cite_start]**100/80/0 Strategy**: Apply **100% coverage** to CORE (domain logic), **80% coverage** to GLOBAL (application/UI), and **0% coverage** to INFRA (static config)[cite: 139, 140, 141, 176, 180, 185].
* [cite_start]**Automated Quality Gates (Husky)**: Implement a mandatory `pre-push` hook using Husky to block any code that fails the test suite or falls below the 80% coverage threshold[cite: 66, 69, 148, 325].
* **Mac-Compatible Setup**: Always ensure the hook is executable by running `chmod +x .husky/pre-push` during project setup.
* [cite_start]**Deterministic Mocking**: All external AI and infrastructure services must be mocked to ensure consistent, cost-effective results[cite: 331, 332].
* [cite_start]**Traceability Validation**: Every AI-generated suggestion must include textual evidence (source excerpts) and be recorded in a `DecisionLog`[cite: 20, 154, 274, 338].
* [cite_start]**Code Smell Detection**: Regularly audit for "God Objects," Magic Numbers, and code duplication to maintain maintainability[cite: 32, 33, 34, 145].



## 🔄 Skill: ResilientLogic
*Design for stability in distributed and non-deterministic AI environments.*

* [cite_start]**Fault Tolerance**: Implement Timeouts, Retries, and **Circuit Breakers** for all external AI API calls[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Statelessness**: Design services to be stateless to facilitate horizontal scaling[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Idempotency**: Ensure processing the same input twice does not result in inconsistent states[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallbacks or "Ambiguous" statuses if a processing step fails, avoiding total system failure[cite: 102, 114, 339].
* [cite_start]**Explicit Error Types**: Define custom, testable domain error classes (e.g., `ValidationError`) rather than generic catches[cite: 53, 101, 128].

## 🤝 Skill: UniversalUX
*Create accessible, transparent, and responsive user interfaces.*

* [cite_start]**Visibility of Status**: Use progress indicators and "Thinking..." animations during long operations[cite: 110, 161, 369].
* [cite_start]**Actionable Feedback**: Provide human-readable error messages with clear paths to resolution[cite: 111, 353, 371].
* [cite_start]**Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**: Maintain full keyboard navigation, high-contrast text, and descriptive ARIA labels[cite: 170, 373, 374, 377].
* [cite_start]**Optimistic UI**: Ensure feedback for user interactions occurs in **<100ms**, with automatic rollbacks on failure[cite: 112, 288, 379].
* [cite_start]**Human-in-the-loop**: The system acts as a "Copilot"; the human user always makes the final call[cite: 23, 60, 251].

## 🧩 Skill: DDDImplementation (Domain-Driven Design)
*Expert-level guidance shifting focus from data structures to business models and behaviors.*

* **Design by Domain vs. Data**: Avoid "Anemic Domain Models." Do not start with DB tables or IDs. Focus on logic first, persistence last.
* **Ubiquitous Language**: Code must reflect business terminology. Use methods like `.enroll()` or `.approve()` instead of generic `.updateStatus()` or `.insertRow()`.
* **Tactical Building Blocks**:
    * **Value Objects**: Eliminate "Primitive Obsession" (e.g., use an `Email` class instead of a `string`). Ensure they are immutable and self-validating.
    * **Aggregates**: Group related entities. Use an **Aggregate Root** to protect business invariants (e.g., ensuring a "Course" never exceeds capacity).
* **Strategic Separation**:
    * **Application Services**: Act as orchestrators only. Fetch data, trigger domain logic, and save. No business logic or HTTP/framework code allowed here.
    * **Ports & Adapters**: Define interfaces in the Domain; implement persistence/APIs in the Infrastructure layer.
* **Decoupled Persistence**: Use explicit **Mappers** to separate domain entities from database schemas. Use `toDomain()` for reconstruction.
* **Refactoring Path**: Avoid "Big Bang" rewrites. Start by identifying primitive data and refactoring it into Value Objects.
